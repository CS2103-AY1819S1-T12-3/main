== PROJECT: Student Schedule Planner

---

== Overview

This Personal Project Portfolio details the contributions which I have made to the Student Schedule Planner(SSP)
project. It also outlines skills which I have picked up, as well as any relevant experiences from other projects
I have worked on.

Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application, created by a team comprised of teamates Chen Shin, Lin Xu,
Park Sang Jun, Xiao Yilin, as well as myself, Thaddeus. It is a planner customised for university students, and it aims
 to help university students manage their time effectively.

SSP incorporates various features that streamline the creation, organisation, and finding of tasks. In addition, it
allows the user to keep track of the current academic week, and has a progress tracking feature, which displays the
user's progress.

Instead of utilising a conventional Graphical User Interface(GUI). SSP is optimised for users who prefer typing out
their commands. This application has the potential to be much faster than regular planner applications, especially for
users who are proficient in typing.

This project started out with

== Summary of contributions

In total, I contributed approximately 1500+ lines of code, in both features and documentation. The features I
implemented were `listmonth`, `filter`, and `filterstrict`.

I also aided in refactoring major parts of the codebase, morphing the original "Address Book (Level 4)" code to suit
our new SSP application. This included changing "addressbook" and "person" references in the code to
"scheduleplanner" and "task" references respectively, as well as various other forms of refactoring.

The features I implemented are as follows:

=== Major enhancements:

1. Ability to *list remaining number of tasks in the current month*

** _What it does:_ This feature allows the user to list all remaining tasks in the current month, in chronological
   order. This feature takes into account leap years.

** _Justification:_ This feature improves the product significantly because the user can narrow the scope of the list
    to the current month, making it easier to manage tasks within this period. This provides a convenient way to list
    tasks that occur in commonly used time frames(day, week, month).

** _Highlights:_ This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an
   in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it had to factor in the variations
    of days between months, and in February during leap years.

** _Credits:_ Code from ListWeekCommand was referenced in the implementation of ListMonthCommand

2. Ability to *filter tasks inclusively according to tags*

** _What it does:_ This feature allows the user to filter tasks inclusively by their tags. This means that given 2 or
more tags as user-input, tasks with ANY of the specified tags will be listed. This includes any number of tags.

** _Justification:_ This feature improves the product significantly because the user can filter out tasks with certain
tags, expediting the search process, and reducing the time needed to find a specific task, or tasks belonging to the
same category.

** _Highlights:_ This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. The
implementation was challenging, as it required the filter feature to be able to search for more multiple tags. This
was made complicated by the fact that each task may contain multiple tags

** _Credits:_ Code from FindCommand was referenced in the implementation of FilterCommand

3. Ability to *filter tasks exclusively according to tags*

** _What it does:_ This feature allows the user to filter tasks exclusively by their tags. This means that given 2 or
more tags to filter, only tasks with ALL of the specified tags will be listed.

** _Justification:_ This feature improves the product significantly because the user can now narrow the scope of the
filter function, further expediting the search process. This feature caters to users who prefer a more strict filter
mechanic.

** _Highlights:_ This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. The
implementation made small tweaks to the filter predicate such that, only tasks containing tags that match all
user-input tags will be displayed. It resulted in a logic error when no tags were provided, allowing all tasks to be
listed instead of returning an error. This logic error was resolved.

** _Credits:_ Code from FilterCommand was referenced in the implementation of FilterCommand
