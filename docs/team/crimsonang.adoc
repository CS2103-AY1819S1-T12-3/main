PROJECT: Student Schedule Planner

---

== Overview

This portfolio showcases the software engineering skills I acquired during my time of study in National University of
 Singapore.

Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application created by my team T12-3 for the CS2103T module. SSP
aimed to help university students to manage their tasks effectively. It is morphed from an existing product called
AddressBook, with constraints such as the primary mode of user input must be via command-line interface.

My contributions to the project included adding `firstday`, `listday` and `listweek` commands to aid the
users in better management of their tasks.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `firstday` *command to generate academic calendar weeks*
** What it does: This feature allows generation of the entire academic calendar weeks based on the
 first day of the academic semester. Whenever the user launches the application within the academic semester, that
 particular week's description will be appended to the application title so the user know which academic week that
 particular week is.
** Justification: This feature allows user to monitor their tasks easier as they may know that they have certain tasks
 due on a particular week and could use this to plan their remaining time properly.
** Highlights: This implementation was challenging as it required creating a new `model` and `storage` for saving and
retrieving the academic week data.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `listday` command to display the tasks from current date.
** Added `listweek` command to display the tasks from current date until the closest Sunday.

The following diagram illustrates that when you used the `listweek` command on `021118`, you will only see tasks
until `041118` which is the closest Sunday.

With the extra layer of data verification and rectification, the user do not need to worry when they accidentally
messed up the storage file.
