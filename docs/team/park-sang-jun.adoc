PROJECT: Student Schedule Planner

---

== Introduction

This project portfolio showcases my contributions to Student Schedule Planner, and how I implemented each of the features.

In this project, I, together with Chen Shin, Lin Xu, Thaddeus Lim and Xiao Yilin, morphed a generic Address Book application into a specialised Student Schedule Planner aimed exclusively at university students. This was done with the constraint that a Command Line Interface (CLI) was to be the main mode of interaction with the application.

As mentioned before, Student Schedule Planner targets a very specific group of people: students. We took into account the pains that we as university students faced when we were using conventional to-do lists and aimed to solve these pains during this project.

Student Schedule Planner is hence a desktop application made specifically for students. The user interacts with the application using a CLI, but it has a Grap
Student Schedule Planner is a desktop schedule planner application used by students for schedule planning. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add recurring tasks*
** What it does: allows the user to add a recurring task by specifying the number of repeats and interval between each repeat.
** Justification: This feature gives convenience to users as users with to-do tasks that happen repeatedly (eg. weekly) will not have to manually add the same tasks over and over again.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a list overdue command that allows the user to view his/her overdue tasks.
