By: `Team T12-3`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction
Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application *aimed at helping students manage their schedules effectively*.
SSP is optimised for users who prefer to type rather than click. In fact, if you type efficiently,
this application will be much faster than regular to-do applications. Move on to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.


== Quick Start
.  Install Java `9` if you do not have it. It is available link:{https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}[here]. +
[WARNING]
The application may not run correctly on Java `10` or Java `11`.

.  Download the latest `studentscheduleplanner.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.The menu that you should see once you open the application.
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing [blue]`help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

****
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in [blue]`add n/NAME`, [blue]`NAME` is a parameter which can be used as [blue]`add n/do CS2100 tutorial`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g [blue]`n/NAME t/[TAG]` can be used as [blue]`n/do CS2100 tutorial
t/CS2100` or as [blue]`n/do CS2100 tutorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. [blue]`t/[TAG]...` can be used
 as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), [blue]`t/tutorial`, [blue]`t/tutorial t/CS2100` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies [blue]`n/NAME d/DEADLINE`, [blue]`d/DEADLINE
n/NAME` is also acceptable.
****

[WARNING]
Please take note that naming is case-sensitive in Student Schedule Planner. For example, `cats` and `Cats` are
considered different. This applies to task, tag as well as category. Only [blue]`find` and [blue]`filter` commands
are case-insensitive for keywords.

=== Viewing Help

Opens the user guide page. +
====
[blue]`help` +
====


=== Adding a Task

Adds a task to the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`add n/NAME p/PRIORITYLEVEL t/[TAG] d/DEADLINE v/VENUE` +
====
Example: +
====
[blue]`add n/exam p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Adds a task named `exam` with priority level `3`,
tag `CS3241` and deadline of `101018` , venue at `mpsh1`.
====
The priority level must be a number between 1 to 3, where 3 denotes highest priority.


[WARNING]
Duplicate tasks are not allowed in Student Schedule Planner; two tasks are considered identical if they
have same name, deadline date, tags, and venue. If two tasks have same attributes except for priority,
they are still considered as identical.
Please take note that task name is case-sensitive. For example, task name `study` and `Study` are
considered different.


[NOTE]
As we have implemented auto-sorting, if you add a task, the task added might get reordered in the task
list. For more detailed guide about auto-sorting, please refer to <<Sorting Tasks by Deadline Date and Priority>>


[WARNING]
The name, priority level, deadline and venue fields are compulsory and required for every task. Tags are optional.

[TIP]
When you add new tasks with new tags (tags that have not been added to any existing categories),
these tags will be automatically added to default category `Others`. For detailed guide about category and tags,
please refer to <<Adding a Category>> and <<Adding a Tag to a Category>>.

// tag::addrepeat[]

=== Adding a Recurring Task

Adds copies of the same task to a specified day in the week, for a given number of weeks. +
====
[blue]`repeat r/REPEATS i/INTERVAL n/NAME p/PRIORITYLEVEL t/[TAG] d/DEADLINE v/VENUE` +
====
Example: +
====
[blue]`repeat r/4 i/7 n/CS2103T Tutorial p/3 t/Tutorial d/111018 v/COM1-0210`

Adds 4 tasks named [blue]`CS2103T Tutorial` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`Tutorial`, venue at [blue]`COM1-0210`, and deadlines on the 11th October 2018, 18th October 2018, 25th October 2018, and 1st November 2018.

The diagram below contains screenshots of the task list before and after the above command was entered:

image::beforeafteraddrepeat.png[width="800"]
====
The number of repeats should be an integer that is greater or equals to 1. Setting the repeat as 1 has the same effect as using the [blue]`add` command.

[TIP]
Use this command to schedule tasks that you carry out regularly.

[WARNING]
The maximum number of repetitions is 15.

[CAUTION]
Due to how the Date class was implemented, there is an unintended behavior. Any task whose deadline goes beyond the year 2099
will have the deadline set to the 21st  century instead. For example, a task created by the AddRepeatCommand that has the deadline
1st January 2101 will instead have the deadline incorrectly set to 1st January 2001.

// end::addrepeat[]

=== Editing a Task

Edits an existing task in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`edit INDEX n/[NAME] p/[PRIORITYLEVEL] t/[TAGS]... d/[DEADLINE] v/[VENUE]`
====
Example:

====
[blue]`edit 3 p/1 d/121019` +
Task with index `3` will have it's priority level change to `1` , and its deadline is changed to `121019`.
====


The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

At least one of the optional fields must be provided. Existing values of provided field
will be updated to the input values.

[WARNING]
Duplicate tasks are not allowed in Student Schedule Planner; two tasks are considered identical if they
have same name, deadline date, tags, and venue. If two tasks have same attributes except for priority,
they are still considered as identical.
Please take note that task name is case-sensitive. For example, task name `study` and `Study` are
considered different.

[NOTE]
As we have implemented auto-sorting, if you edited the `date` or `priority`, the task might get reordered in the task
list. For more detailed guide about auto-sorting, please refer to <<Sorting Tasks by Deadline Date and Priority>>

[WARNING]
Existing tags of a task will be removed when its tag is edited. If input is
[blue]`edit 3 t/project`, then the resulting tag(s) of task 3 will be `project` only.

[TIP]
To remove all tags of an existing task e.g for task with index number `3`, you can type [blue]`edit 3 t/`, all the
tags of the task of index number `3` will be removed.


[TIP]
Use [blue]`list`, [blue]`listday` or [blue]`listweek` to find out the index of the task to be modified. +
For example, you can use [blue]`listday` to list the tasks due today, and choose the index of the task you want
 to edit.


=== Deleting a Task

Deletes the specified task from the schedule planner forever. +

====
[blue]`delete INDEX`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`delete 3` +
Task with index number `3` delete from schedule planner.
====
The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
[TIP]
Use the [BLUE]`list` command to find out the index of the task to be deleted.

//tag::archivetask[]
=== Archiving a Task

Archives the specified task from the schedule planner. Once a task is archived, it will be hidden from task list. You can
view archived tasks in archived task list using [blue]`listarchived` command. For detailed guide regarding
viewing archived tasks, please refer to <<Viewing Archived Tasks>>. +

====
[blue]`archive INDEX`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`archive 1` +
Task with index `1` is removed from the task list. +
Below is the partial screenshots of task list before and after executing the archive command.

image::archiveTask.png[width="300"]
====
The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
[TIP]
Use the [blue]`listarchived` command to find out the index of the task to be archived.
View <<Viewing Archived Tasks>> for detailed guide.
[WARNING]
Any archived tasks with deadline date earlier than 2 weeks before current date will be
deleted from schedule planner when the application relaunches.
//end::archivetask[]

// tag::listarchived[]
=== Viewing Archived Tasks

image::archiveTask.png[width="400"]

Step 2: [blue]`listarchived`

Below is the screenshot of archived task list that will appear on screen after step 2.

image::listArchive.png[width="400"]

====
// end::listarchived[]

=== Viewing All Tasks

Lists all tasks in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`list`
====

// tag::listoverdue[]

=== Viewing Overdue Tasks

Shows a list all the overdue tasks. +
====
[blue]`listoverdue`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`listoverdue` on the date 11 Nov '18 (111118)

Shows a list of tasks due on 10 Nov '18 (101118) and before.

The following diagram contains screenshots of the task list before and after the command above was entered:

image::beforeafterlistoverdue.png[width="800"]
====

// end::listoverdue[]

// tag::listday[]
=== Viewing Tasks Due Today

Shows a list of tasks that are due today. +
====
[blue]`listday`
====
// end::listday[]

// tag::listweek[]
=== Viewing Tasks Due This Week

Shows a list of tasks that are due from current date till the closest Sunday. +
====
[blue]`listweek`
====

Example:
====
The following diagram illustrates that when you used [blue]`listweek` command on the date `021118` (02 Nov '18), you will only see tasks
until `041118` (04 Nov '18) which is the closest Sunday.

image::ListWeekCommand_UG_Before_After.png[width="500"]
====
// end::listweek[]

Tasks from 02 Nov '18 to end of the month (30 Nov '18) are listed.
====
// end::listmonth[]

//tag::sorting[]
=== Viewing Tasks in the Order of Deadline Date and Priority
All tasks are automatically loaded in the order of deadlines except for archived tasks.
The order of tasks first depends on deadline date, then priority. +
Given below is an example of two tasks with different deadline dates.
Task `Do CS2030 lab` is listed before task `Self study` because it has
earlier deadline date.

image::sortingdate.png[width="300"]

If two tasks have the same deadline, the order then depends on priority, one that has
higher priority will appear in front of one that has lower priority. 3 is the highest priority, while 1 is the lowest. +
Given below is an example of two tasks with the same deadline dates.


image::sortingpriority.png[width="300"]

[WARNING]
Please take note that archived tasks are not shown in order.

//end::sorting[]

=== Finding Tasks by Name

Finds tasks whose names match with given keyword. +
====
[blue]`find NAME`
====
Example:
====
[blue]`find tutorial` +
All tasks with `tutorial` in their names are listed.
====
[NOTE]
The keyword must be whole word. +
E.g for finding `tutorial`, `tutorial` must be used, `tut` or other variations would not be allowed.

The search is case insensitive. For example, `apples` and  `Apples` both return the same tasks.

The order of the keywords does not matter. For example,  `apples buy` and `buy apples` both return the
same tasks. +

[TIP]
You can include multiple keywords when using `find`. [blue]`find CS3230 CS5229` will find all tasks with name containing
`CS3230` or `CS5229`.


// tag::filtertags[]
=== Filtering Tasks by Tags (Inclusive)

image::b-a filter tutorial cs2100.png[width="600"]

Tasks with either `tutorial`, `2100` tags, or both, are listed.
====

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `apples` matches `Apples`.

=== Filtering Tasks by Tags (Exclusive)
Filters tasks with tags matching ALL of those entered by the user.
You can include multiple tags when using [blue]`filterstrict`. For example, [blue]`filterstrict tutorial quiz project`
will return tasks with tags matching ALL user-input tags.
====

// end::filtertags[]

// tag::firstday[]
=== Generating Academic Calendar

Generates the entire academic calendar with description, based on the first academic day and stores it in storage.

Currently, the generated academic calendar is based on the academic calender of National University of Singapore
(NUS). It may not be compatible with academic calendars from other institutions.

Whenever the application is launched within the academic calendar's dates, the application title will append that
particular week's description to the title of the application. +

====
[blue]`firstday DDMMYY`
====

Example:
====
The following diagram illustrates when you used [blue]`firstday` command with the date `130818`
and launch the application within `121118` to `181118` (Week 13 for
NUS academic year 18/19 semester 1), the application title will be appended with "Week 13".

image::FirstDayCommand_UG_Before_After.png[width="500"]
====

[NOTE]
There would not be any visible changes upon using the command. The reflection would only occurs after relaunching the
application.

`DDMMYY` refers to the date format of day, month and year. It must complies the following three rules in
order:

1. `DDMMYY` must only be one set of value such as `130818`. Value such as `130818 200818` or `130818 20`
will be rejected as they are considered as more than one set of date.

2. `DDMMYY` must be a valid date within 21st century.

3. `DDMMYY` must be a Monday.
// end::firstday[]

//tag::addingcat[]
=== Adding a Category

You can organize tags by adding tags to relevant categories. For detailed guide about
how to add tags to category, please refer to <<Adding a Tag to a Category>>. +
====
[blue]`addcat c/CATEGORY`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`addcat c/Steam shopping list`

image::addingcat.png[width="300"]

Category name can contain space. For example, `Steam`, `Steam2`,
`Steam shopping list` are all valid category names. +


`Modules` and `Others` are two categories exist by default.

[WARNING]
Please take note that category is case-sensitive. For example, category `cats` and category `Cats` are
considered different.

[WARNING]
Duplicated categories are not allowed in schedule planner. All
categories must have different names.

[TIP]
All non-default categories (categories except `Modules` and `Others` can be removed.
For detailed guide about how to remove categories, please refer to <<Deleting a Category>>.

[TIP]
All non-default categories (categories except `Modules` and `Others` can be renamed.

//end::addingcat[]

//tag::addingtag[]
=== Adding a Tag to a Category
Adds a tag to selected existing category.
====
[blue]`addtag c/CATEGORY t/TAG`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`addtag c/Steam shopping list t/Overwatch`

image::addtag.png[width="300"]
====

[WARNING]
Duplicated tags are not allowed under same category. +
For instance, in above example, you cannot add another tag `Overwatch`
to category `Steam shopping list`. However you can save same tag under multiple categories.
Please take note that naming of tag is case-sensitive. For example, tag name `cat` and `Cat`
are considered different.

[TIP]
When you add new tasks with new tags (tags that have not been added to any existing categories),
these tags will be automatically added to default category `Others`.

[TIP]
For how to remove tags from categories, please refer to <<Clearing a Category>>.
//end::addingtag[]

//tag::clearcat[]
=== Clearing a Category

====
[blue]`clearcat c/Modules`

image::clearcat.png[width="300"]
====
When a category is cleared, tags saved in other categories are not affected.
For instance, in above example, if you have tag `CS2105` in category `Others`
as well, after clearing category `Modules`, tag `CS2105` will still exist in category
`Others`. +
On the other hand, if tag `CS2105` is only saved under category `Modules`, then after clearing
category `Modules`, the tag `CS2105` will be removed from schedule planner.
