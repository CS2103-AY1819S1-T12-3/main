== Introduction
Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application *aimed at helping students manage their schedules effectively*. SSP is optimised for users who prefer to type rather than click. In fact, if you type efficiently, this application will be much faster than regular to-do applications. Move on to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.


== Quick Start
.  Install Java `9` if you do not have it. It is available link:{https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}[here]. +
[WARNING]
The application may not run correctly on Java `10` or Java `11`.

.  Download the latest `studentscheduleplanner.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.The menu that you should see once you open the application.

=== Adding a Task

Adds a task to the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`add [n/NAME] [p/PRIORITYLEVEL] [t/TAG] [d/DEADLINE] [v/VENUE]` +
====
Example: +
====
Input: [blue]`add n/exam p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Outcome: Adds a task named [blue]`exam` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`CS3241` and deadline of 10th October 2018, venue at mpsh1.
====
The priority level must be a number between 1 to 3, where 3 denotes highest priority.

[WARNING]
A task strictly requires a name, priority level and deadline. Tags are optional.


=== Adding a Recurring Task

Adds copies of the same task to the same day of a given number of weeks. +
====
[blue]`repeat [r/REPEATS] [n/NAME] [p/PRIORITYLEVEL] [t/TAG] [d/DEADLINE] [v/VENUE]` +
====
Example: +
====
Input: [blue]`add r/3 n/Lecture p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Outcome: Adds 3 tasks named [blue]`Lecture` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`CS3241`, venue at [blue]`mpsh1`, and deadline of 10th October 2018, 17th October 2018, and 24th October 2018.
====
The number of repeats should be an integer that is greater or equals to 1. Setting the repeat as 1 has the same effect as using the `add` command.

[TIP]
Use this command to schedule tasks that you carry out regularly.

=== Listing All Tasks

Shows a list of all tasks in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`list`
====

=== Editing a Task

will be updated to the input values.

[blue]`edit 3 t/project`, then the tag of task 3 will be [blue]`project` only.

[TIP]
To remove all tags of a existing task, you can just type [blue]`c/`.
If input is [blue]`task 3 c/`, all the tags of the task with `INDEX` 3 will be removed.



[TIP]
Use the [blue]`list task`, [blue]`listday` or [blue]`listweek` to find out the index of the task to be modified.
