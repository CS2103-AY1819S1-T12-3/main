== Introduction
Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application *aimed at helping students manage their schedules effectively*. SSP is optimised for users who prefer to type rather than click. In fact, if you type efficiently, this application will be much faster than regular to-do applications. Move on to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.


== Quick Start
.  Install Java `9` if you do not have it. It is available link:{https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}[here]. +
[WARNING]
The application may not run correctly on Java `10` or Java `11`.

.  Download the latest `studentscheduleplanner.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.The menu that you should see once you open the application.

.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing [blue]`help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

****
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in [blue]`add n/NAME`, [blue]`NAME` is a parameter which can be used as [blue]`add n/do CS2100 tutorial`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g [blue]`n/[NAME] t/[TAG]` can be used as [blue]`n/do CS2100 tutorial
t/CS2100` or as [blue]`n/do CS2100 tutorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. [blue]`t/[TAG]...` can be used
 as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), [blue]`t/tutorial`, [blue]`t/tutorial t/CS2100` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies [blue]`n/[NAME] d/[DEADLINE]`, [blue]`d/[DEADLINE]
n/[NAME]` is also acceptable.
****

[TIP]
All tasks will be automatically loaded in the order of deadlines, one that due earlier will appear before one that
due later. If two tasks have the same deadline, they will be arranged according to priority, one that has
higher priority will appear in front of one that has lower priority. 3 is the highest priority, while 1 is the lowest. +

=== Viewing Help

Opens the user guide page. +
====
[blue]`help` +
====


=== Adding a Task

Adds a task to the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`add n/[NAME] p/[PRIORITYLEVEL] t/[TAG] d/[DEADLINE] v/[VENUE]` +
====
Example: +
====
Input: [blue]`add n/exam p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Outcome: Adds a task named [blue]`exam` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`CS3241` and deadline of 10th October 2018, venue at mpsh1.
====
The priority level must be a number between 1 to 3, where 3 denotes highest priority.

[WARNING]
The name, priority level and deadline fields are compulsory and required for every task. Tags are optional.


=== Adding a Recurring Task

Adds copies of the same task to a specified day in the week, for a given number of weeks. +
====
[blue]`repeat r/[REPEATS] n/[NAME] p/[PRIORITYLEVEL] t/[TAG] d/[DEADLINE] v/[VENUE]` +
====
Example: +
====
Input: [blue]`add r/3 n/Lecture p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Outcome: Adds 3 tasks named [blue]`Lecture` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`CS3241`, venue at [blue]`mpsh1`, and deadline of 10th October 2018, 17th October 2018, and 24th October 2018.
====
The number of repeats should be an integer that is greater or equals to 1. Setting the repeat as 1 has the same effect as using the `add` command.

[TIP]
Use this command to schedule tasks that you carry out regularly.

=== Listing All Tasks

Lists all tasks in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`list`
====

=== Editing a Task

Edits an existing task in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`edit [INDEX] n/[NAME] p/[PRIORITYLEVEL] t/[TAGS]... d/[DEADLINE]`
====
Example:

====
Input: [blue]`edit 3 p/1 d/121019` +
Outcome: Priority of existing task with index 3 to 1, and its deadline is changed to 12th October 2019 .
====


The [blue]`INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The [blue]`INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

At least one of the optional fields must be provided. Existing values of provided field
will be updated to the input values.

[WARNING]
Existing tags of a task will be removed when its tag is edited. If input is
[blue]`edit 3 t/project`, then the resulting tag(s) of task 3 will be [blue]`project` only.

[TIP]
To remove all tags of an existing task, you can just type [blue]`t/`.
If input is [blue]`task 3 t/`, all the tags of the task with `INDEX` 3 will be removed.


[TIP]
Use [blue]`list task`, [blue]`listday` or [blue]`listweek` to find out the index of the task to be modified. +
For example, you can use [blue]`listday` to list the tasks due today, and choose the index of the task you want
 to edit.


=== Finding Tasks by Name

Finds tasks whose names match with given keyword. +
====
[blue]`find [NAME]`
====
Example:
====
input: [blue]`find tutorial` +
output: All tasks with "tutorial" in their names are listed.
====

The search is case insensitive. For example, [blue]`apples` and  [blue]`Apples` both return the same tasks.

The order of the keywords does not matter. For example,  [blue]`apples buy` and [blue]`buy apples` both return the
same tasks. +

[TIP]
You can include multiple keywords when using [blue]`find`. [blue]`find CS3230 CS5229` will find all tasks with name containing
[blue]`CS3230` or [blue]`CS5229`.


=== Filtering Tasks by Tag
Filters and lists tasks with tags matching those entered by the user. User may input more than 1 tag. +
====
[blue]`filter [TAG] [TAG2] ...`
====
Example:
====
input: [blue]`filter tutorial` +
output: All tasks with the tag [blue]`tutorial` are listed.

input: [blue]`filter tutorial 2100` +
output: All tasks with the tag either [blue]`tutorial`, [blue]`2100`, or both [blue]`tutorial` and [blue]`2100`, are
listed.
====

The search is case insensitive. e.g [blue]`apples` matches [blue]`Apples`.


[TIP]
You can include multiple tags when using [blue]`filter`. [blue]`filter tutorial quiz project`
will return all tasks with tag matching with at least one of the provided tags in input.


=== Deleting a Task

Deletes the specified task from the schedule planner. +

====
[blue]`delete task INDEX`
====

Example:
====
input: [blue]`delete task 3` +
output: Task with index 3 delete from schedule planner.
====
The [blue]`INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The [blue]`INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
[TIP]
Use the `list` command to find out the index of the task to be deleted.

=== Archiving a Task

====
[blue]`archive INDEX`
====

Example:
====
input: [blue]`archive 4` +
output: Task with index 4 is removed from the current list and saved in the archived list.
====
The [blue]`INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.

=== Generating Weeks in the Academic Calendar

Generates the entire academic calendar with description, based on the first academic day and stores it in storage.

Currently, the generated academic calendar is based on the academic calender of National University of Singapore
(NUS). It may not be compatible with academic calendars from other institutions.

Whenever the application is launched within the academic calendar's dates, the application title
will append that particular week's description to the title of the app. +

====
[blue]`firstday [DDMMYY]`
====

Example:
====
input: [blue]`firstday 130818` +
output: When the user launches the application from E.g 221018 to 281018 (Week 10 for NUS academic year 18/19
semester 1), the application title will append "Week 10" to the title of the app.
====
The [blue]`[DDMMYY]` refers to the date format of day, month and year. It must complies the following three rules in
order:

1. The [blue]`DDMMYY]` must only be one set of value such as `130818`. Value such as `130818 200818` or `130818 20`
will be
rejected as they are considered as more than one set of date.

2. The [blue]`DDMMYY` must be a valid date within 21st century.

3. The [blue]`DDMMYY` must be a Monday.

====


=== Undoing Previous Command
Restores the schedule planner to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +

====
[blue]`undo`
====

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the schedule planner's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

[TIP]
Use the `history` command to decide if you want to undo the previous _undoable_ command.



=== Redoing the Previous Undo Command

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
====
[blue]`redo`
====
Examples:
