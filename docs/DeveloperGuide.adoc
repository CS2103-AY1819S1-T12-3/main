== Introduction
This Developer Guide for the Student Schedule Planner is written by the SSP team for the benefits of future
developers and maintainers of the application.

Student Schedule Planner is a desktop application aims to help students save their tasks manage them all in one place
.

This introduction briefly covers the main flow of the Developer Guide:

*2. Setting up* : Walkthrough on the prequisites steps to setup the Developer Environment

*3. Design* : Overview on the structure of the project code, and how each component interacts with each other.


*4. Implementation* : In-depth explanation on the implementation of the various features in the Schedule Planner, as
well as the considerations behind the implementations

*5. Documentation* : General guide on the documentation process of the project

*6. Testing* : Documentation for the coverage tests of the application and how to set up your testing environment.

*7. DevOps* : General processes used during development phase, and documentation on how to set it up.


== Setting up

Before you start working on the project, please make sure that you have completed the necessary prerequisites.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
*JDK `10`* on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github
.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use *JDK `9`*.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/storage/XmlAdaptedTask.java[`XmlAdaptedTask.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order:

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `ssp/scheduleplanner`
repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `ssp/scheduleplanner`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section covers the structural design of the App, as well as how its various components interact with each other.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below explains the structural design of the App. It is followed by is a quick
overview of each component.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level. They are:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The component which holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The component which reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a ` (_Component Name_)Manager` class.

For example, `Logic`(see the class diagram given below) defines its API in `Logic.java` interface
and exposes its functionality using `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command
`delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteTask.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
`Model` simply raises a `SchedulePlannerChangedEvent` when the schedule planner data is changed, instead of
asking `Storage` to save updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how `EventsCenter` reacts to the event, after which the updates are saved
to the hard disk, and the status bar of the `UI` is updated to reflect 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through `EventsCenter` to `Storage` and `UI`, without `Model` having to be coupled to either of
them. This is an example of how Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java//ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of `MainWindow`, which is made up of `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `SidebarPanel` etc.

All these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

`UI` uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

`UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

Below are the steps of how `Logic` executes an user command:

.  `Logic` uses `SchedulePlannerParser` to parse the user command.
.  This creates a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
.  The result is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within `Logic` for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Sequence diagram for `delete 1` Command within Logic Component
image::DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component does the following:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Schedule Planner data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable, observable `ObservableList<Task>`  e.g. UI can be bound to this list, such that it
automatically updates when data in the list changes.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Schedule Planner`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `Schedule Planner` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component does the following:

* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* Saves the Schedule Planner data in xml format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ssp.scheduleplanner.commons` package.

== Current Implementation

This section elaborates on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo commands

The Undo/Redo feature allows the user to revert the schedule planner to an earlier state when 'undo' is called, or a
later state when 'redo' is called.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSchedulePlanner`.
It extends `SchedulePlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `SchedulePlannerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSchedulePlanner.commit()` -- Saves the current schedule planner state in 'history'.
* `VersionedSchedulePlanner.undo()` -- Restores the previous schedule planner state from 'history'.
* `VersionedSchedulePlanner.redo()` -- Restores a previously undone schedule planner state from 'history'.

These operations are exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#commitSchedulePlanner()`, `Model#undoSchedulePlanner()` and `Model#redoSchedulePlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `VersionedSchedulePlanner` will be initialized with the
 initial schedule planner state, with `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single schedule planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSchedulePlanner()`, as a result
 the modified state of the schedule planner is saved in `schedulePlannerStateList` after the `delete 5` command
 executes, the `currentStatePointer` shifts to the newly inserted schedule planner state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/CS2100 Lect ...` to add a new task. The `add` command calls
`Model#commitSchedulePlanner()
`, and the modified schedule planner state is saved into `schedulePlannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command execution fails, it will not call `Model#commitSchedulePlanner()`, so the schedule planner state will not
 be saved into `schedulePlannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call
`Model#undoSchedulePlanner()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` to the previous index, pointing to the
previous schedule planner state, and restoring the schedule planner to its previous state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0(i.e the initial schedule planner state), then there are no previous states to restore to. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSchedulePlanner()` to check this case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSchedulePlanner()`, which shifts the
`currentStatePointer` to the next index, pointing to the next state, and restores the schedule planner to
that state.

[NOTE]
If `currentStatePointer` is at index `schedulePlannerStateList.size() - 1` (i.e pointing to the latest state), then there are no latest states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSchedulePlanner()` to check this case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then executes the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the schedule planner, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitSchedulePlanner()`, `Model#undoSchedulePlanner()` or `Model#redoSchedulePlanner()`. Thus, the `schedulePlannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSchedulePlanner()`. If the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing to the latest state in the `schedulePlannerStateList`, all states after the
`currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The entire schedule planner is saved.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Each individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: It will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A list is used to store the history of schedule planner states.
** Pros: It is easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `VersionedSchedulePlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** `HistoryManager` is used for undo/redo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: It requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. It violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Log Messages

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. `LogsCenter` class is used to manage logging levels and
destinations.

How to log:

* The logging level can be controlled using `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* The log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

The following are logging levels used:

* `SEVERE` : This is for critical problems detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : This is to warn that application can continue running, but with caution
* `INFO` : This is for information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : This is for details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::viewarangeoftasks[]
=== View Day/Week

In order to enable users to better manage their tasks in the schedule planner, we added two more variations of
 the `list` command.

The `listday` command supports viewing tasks due the current date whereas `listweek` command supports viewing tasks
from the current date till the closest Sunday.

==== Current Implementation

`listday`/`listweek` mechanism utilises the same implementation used by the
`list` command:

* `Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` -- Takes in a predicate parameter and updates the model
according to the predicate.

`listday`/`listweek` uses `DateSamePredicate`/`DateWeekSamePredicate` as the predicate respectively for
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList()`.

When `listday` is executed, `DateSamePredicate` will reference the current
system date to filter the list. `model#updateFilteredTaskList()` uses the predicate `DateSamePredicate`
to return an updated list of tasks with deadlines that match the system date.

When `listweek` is executed, `DateWeekSamePredicate` will obtain several dates, from the current system date
until the closest Sunday, to use as the 'filter'. `model#updateFilteredTaskList()` uses `DateWeekSamePredicate`
to update the list to include tasks with deadline that matches any of those dates.

As both `listday`/`listweek` commands are similar, we will only illustrate how `listweek` works.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how `listweek` mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user entered the command `listweek`.

Step 2. `ListWeekCommand#appendDateList(datelist, numDaysTillSunday(dateName))` will generate the `dateList`, which
is a `list` of dates in `ddmmyy` format after retrieving the result from `numDaysTillSunday()` method.
`numDaysTillSunday()` method itself will compute the number of days from current date till Sunday based on `dateName`.

Step 3. `model.updateFilteredTaskList()` will update the task list with `DateWeekSamePredicate`
as the parameter. `DateWeekSamePredicate` itself would take `dateList` in Step 2 as the paramter.

Step 4. The updated task list would be reflected on the UI to be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mechanism works:

.Sequence Diagram of ListWeek Command
image::ListWeekCommand_DG_SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::viewarangeoftasks[]
.Sequence Diagram of ListMonth Command
image::ListMonthCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
// tag::viewarangeoftasks2[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How does listday and listweek function

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter accordingly based on the command itself
** Pros: It is easy to implement and use.
** Cons: It restrict to view all tasks from current date or from current date till Sunday only.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow the commands to receive argument for which date(s) to filter.
E.g listday 130818 to view all tasks for 13 August 2018.
** Pros: It allows viewing for different date(s).
** Cons: It would cause inconvenience for entering the date(s) each time the command was to be used.
// end::viewarangeoftasks2[]

// tag::generateacademiccalendar[]
=== Generate Academic Calendar Weeks

In order to enable users to better monitor their tasks in the schedule planner by knowing what is the current
academic week, we added `firstday` command.

The `firstday` command will generate the weeks referencing to NUS academic calendar, and will append the week
description to the application title if the user launches the application within the academic calendar dates.
This allows the user to know the current academic week.

[NOTE]
The number of weeks referencing NUS academic calendar is fixated at 17 weeks.

==== Current Implementation

`firstday` mechanism is faciliated by `FirstDayCommand` and implements the following operations:

* `FirstDayCommand#isWithinDateRange(firstDayOfSem, lastDayOfSem)` -- Check if current system date is within the
`firstDayOfSem` and `lastDayOfSem` and return true or false.

* `FirstDayCommand#retrieveWeekDescription(rangeOfWeek)` -- It return the description of a particular week

* `FirstDayCommand#saveRangeOfWeeks(rangeOfWeek)` -- It save the academic calendar weeks data into `rangeofweek.xml`

* `FirstDayCommand#retrieveRangeOfWeeks(storeRangeOfWeeks)` -- It retrieves the saved academic calendar weeks data from
`rangeofweek.xml`

* `FirstDayCommand#computeRangeOfWeek(firstDay)` -- It generate the academic calendar weeks data based on the `firstDay`
 parameter.

* `FirstDayCommand#addDescription` -- It appends description for each academic calendar weeks.

* `FirstDayCommand#isMonday(inputDate)` -- It checks if inputDate is Monday and return true or false.

* `FirstDayCommand#computeAppTitle()` -- It computes the corresponding application title after checking if current
system date is within academic calendar dates.

* `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfNotExist()` -- It creates the default `rangeofweek.xml` if it does not exist.

* `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfSizeDiff()` -- It creates the default `rangeofweek.xml` if the number of
entries differ from the expected academic number of weeks.

* `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfNull()` -- It creates the default `rangeofweek.xml` if any data is null.

* `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfInvalidDateOrRange()` -- It creates the default `rangeofweek.xml` if date data in
modified to be an invalid date or date range format.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `firstday` mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user enter the command `firstday 130818`

Step 2. `FirstDayCommandParser` will be activated as the command word `firstday` is used. It will then trimmed the
remaining argument into `trimmedArgs`.

Step 3. Methods `onlyOneSetArgument(trimmedArgs)`, `Date.isValidDate(trimmedArgs)` and `isMonday(trimmedArgs)` are used
 in sequence to check if
`trimmedArgs` is valid.

[NOTE]
If either method in Step 3 failed, `ParseException` with respective message will be thrown to inform user what had
gone wrong. `FirstDayCommand` would then not be called.

Step 4. `FirstDayCommand` will be called with the validated `trimmedArgs` as its parameter.

Step 5. `FirstDayCommand#execute` will be activated by the `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `FirstDayCommand#computeRangeOfWeeks(trimmedArgs)` will be activated and generate the academic calendar weeks
. This method will further call `FirstDayCommand#addDescriptionForWeeks` to add description for each of the academic
calendar weeks. The academic calendar weeks will be stored in a `2D String array` named `rangeOfWeek`.

Step 7. `FirstDayCommand#saveRangeOfWeeks(rangeOfWeek)` will be activated. It will create a
`XmlSerializableRangeOfWeek` object with `rangeOfWeek` as its parameter to allow the `rangeOfWeek` data to be
converted into `Xml` format to be easily saved. Next, this method would call `XmlFileStorage#saveWeekDataToFile` to
save the `XmlSerializableRangeOfWeek` object data into `Xml` format in `rangeofweek.xml`

[NOTE]
`CommandException` will be thrown if `rangeofweek.xml` does not exist.

Step 8. After the data had been saved properly, should the current system date lies within the academic calendar
weeks, the `UI` would display the corresponding week description to the user.

image::FirstDayCommand_UG_Bef.png[width="600"]

Step 9. When user launch the application,`MainApp` will create a `FirstDayCommand` object named `fdc` to utilise the
method `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfNotExist`, `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfDiffSize`,
`FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfNull` and `FirstDayCommand#createDefaultFileIfInvalidDateOrRange`.

If it is the first time the user launch the application or if user deleted the `rangeofweek.xml` or modified the file
content until some content are invalid, the application will create a default `rangeofweek.xml`.
// end::generateacademiccalendar[]
// tag::generateacademiccalendar2[]
Step 10. `MainApp` will create a `Config` object named as `updateConfig` and then calls the method `updateConfig.setAppTitle(fdc.computeAppTitle())`. `fdc.computeAppTitle()` would generate the corresponding application title by
checking the current system date and the saved academic calendar weeks data. It would then return the result into
`updateConfig.setAppTitle()` to update the application title.

`MainApp` then calls `ConfigUtil#saveConfig(updateConfig, configFilePathUsed)` to save the updated configuration into
 the path where `config.json` is.

Step 11. `MainApp` would then retrieve the application title from `config.json` and display on the `UI`.

image::FirstDayCommand_UG_Aft.png[width="400"]

[NOTE]
`CommandException` will be thrown if data from `rangeofweek.xml` could not be converted or if `rangeofweek.xml` does
not exist.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mechanism works:

.Sequence diagram of launching MainApp
image::LaunchMainApp_DG_SequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How firstday functions

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate entire academic calendar weeks by input the first academic monday date.
** Pros: It would only need one set of date.
** Cons: It would require many methods to validate, generate the data.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to create their own academic calendar such as having customised number of weeks and
description for each weeks.
** Pros: It would allow customisation.
** Cons: It would be time and effort consuming for the user and also to validate the data.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the firstday method

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `2D String array` is used.
** Pros: It would allow easy data retrieval.
** Cons: It could cause confusion especially if magic numbers were used instead of constant.
* **Alternative 2:** `Arraylist` is used.
** Pros: It would not require sequential memory for storage.
** Cons: It would not allow data retrieval at any specific index which requires traversing the `arraylist`.

// end::generateacademiccalendar2[]

// tag::filtertags[]
=== Filter Tags

The `filter` command allows the user to filter tasks in the schedule planner according to their tags. The user may
search for multiple tags at once, and the schedule planner returns a list of tasks containing any of the tags
specified by the user.

==== Current Implementation

The filter mechanism utilises "FilterCommandParser" to parse the user command into separate tags e.g `filter tag1
 tag2` will search for tasks with either tags `tag1`, `tag2`, or both.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `filter tutorial CS2100`

Step 2. The 'filter' command parses the argument `tutorial CS2100` into separate words `tutorial` and `CS2100` which
are stored in a list in `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Step 3. `FilterCommand` is then created, which contains `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`, a predicate which searches
for the tags 'tutorial' and 'CS2100'. `FilterCommand.execute()` returns a list of tasks containing any of the tags input by the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How filter executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The filter command is inclusive i.e filtering for A and B returns tasks with A,
 B, or both.
** Pros: It is easy to implement, it is also consistent with how the 'find' command works.
** Cons: It is not as specific.

* **Alternative 2:** The filter command is exclusive, i.e filtering for A and B returns tasks with A & B
** Pros: It is more specific (e.g. filters the tasks more strictly).
** Cons: It is inconsistent with the original implementation of the 'find' command. It is more difficult to implement.

//end::filtertags[]

//tag::listoverdue[]
=== List Overdue Tasks
The `listoverdue` command allows the user to view the list of all overdue tasks. A task is considered overdue if its
deadline has passed. In other words, the system's current date is after the deadline.

==== Current Implementation
Model contains a UniqueTaskList called tasks.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list overdue mechanism behaves at each step:

.Sequence Diagram of ListOverdueCommand
image::ListOverdueSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Step 1. The user executes the command `listoverdue`.

Step 2. `model.updateFilteredTaskList()` will update the task list with `OverduePredicate` as the parameter
`OverduePredicate` itself takes the current system date in the yyMMdd format.

Step 3. The updated task list would be reflected on the UI to be displayed to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the overdue tasks are stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The overdue tasks are not stored in a separate UniqueTaskList. Instead, the
UniqueTaskList tasks is filtered with OverduePredicate each time the `listoverdue` command is called.
** Pros: Does not require a new UniqueTaskList.
** Cons: If the number of tasks is huge, filtering will take a long time. However, this is not a problem since
the number of tasks is small at any given point of time.

* **Alternative 2:** The overdue tasks are stored in a new UniqueTaskList.
** Pros: Retrieving is overdue tasks is faster.
** Cons: A new UniqueTaskList has to be implemented.
//end::listoverdue[]

//tag::listarchivedtasks[]

=== List Archived Tasks

The `listarchived` command allows the user to view the list of all archived tasks. Whenever the user completes a task,
he/she will archive it. When archived, the task will be moved from the task list into a separate archive list that stores
all completed tasks. If the user wishes to view all of his/her completed tasks, the `listarchived` command will display
all of the archived tasks.

==== Current Implementation

Model contains two UniqueTaskLists - tasks and archivedTasks - each containing the tasks and archived tasks respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list archived mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `listarchived`.

Step 2. The `listarchived` command raises a new ChangeViewEvent that signals a change to archived view.

Step 3. MainWindow responds to the ChangeViewEvent with MainWindow#handleChangeViewEvent().

Step 4. MainWindow calls Logic#getFilteredArchivedTaskList(). It then creates a new TaskListPanel instance with Tasks in that list.

Step 5. MainWindow places the new TaskListPanel in the TaskListPanelPlaceHolder. The archived tasks are now displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list archive operation works:

image::ListArchivedSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to change what is displayed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The task list panel's contents are replaced with a new task list containing archived tasks.
** Pros: Only one section of the UI has to be changed.

* **Alternative 2:** Two JavaFX scenes are created. To handle display changes, switch to the corresponding scene.
** Pros: It is the proper way of handling change in display with JavaFX.
** Cons: Since only one section of the UI needs to be changed, changing the whole scene seems redundant.

//end::listarchivedtasks[]

//tag::displaytagsinsidebar[]

=== Display Tags in Sidebar

Whenever the user tags a task with a new tag, the tag will be added to the sidebar panel. The user will be able to view
all of the tags he/she has used to categorize tasks.

[coming in v1.4]

==== Current Implementation

//end::displaytagsinsidebar[]

//tag::progressbar[]
=== Display Progress Bar

The `progresstoday` and `progressweek` commands display the percentage of tasks archived for the current day and week respectively. The progress bars at the bottom also reflect the percentages automatically without the need for any commands to be entered.

==== Current Implementation

Whenever the user makes a change in the schedule planner, for example add, delete, or archive a task, it raises a new SchedulePlannerChangedEvent.
UI part ProgressBarPanel will handle this event and update the values for both today and this week's progress bars.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the progress bar mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. User adds a new Task for today.

Step 2. A new SchedulePlannerChangedEvent is raised.

Step 3. ProgressBarPanel handles the event with ProgressBarPanel#handleSchedulePlannerChangedEvent().

Step 4. The taskList is retrieved by SchedulePlannerChangedEvent#data.getTaskList(). The archivedTaskList is retrieved by SchedulePlannerChangedEvent#data.getArchivedTaskList().

Step 5. ProgressBarPanel#updateProgressBars(taskList, archivedTaskList) is called.

Step 6. After filtering through each lists with the DateSamePredicate, their sizes are calculated.

Step 7. The number of completed tasks for today is the size of the filtered archived list, while the total number of tasks for today is the size of both the filtered archived list and the filtered task list.

Step 8. The fraction is calculated from completed / total. Then the progress bar for today is set to that fraction.

Step 9. The same is done for this week's progress bar but the lists are filtered with DateWeekSamePredicate.

The following sequence diagram shows how the progress bar mechanism works:

== Documentation

We used asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable method is Method 3. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to
platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `ssp.scheduleplanner.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ that target the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `ssp.scheduleplanner.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that check the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests check multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/ssp/scheduleplanner/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Schedule Planner depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives: +
a. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
